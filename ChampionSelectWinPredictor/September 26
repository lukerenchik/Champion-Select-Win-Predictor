I have been trying to improve my model accuracy over the past week. I am getting values around 53% accuracy on a binary
problem, which seems rather low. I am aiming for 60%+. So far I tried a naieve approach where I just gave the model the
names of the champions and attempted to get it to draw conclusions about their power against one another, that model
was highly volitile with results between 51-54% accuracy. I then added simple encodings that were made by another programmer,
these improved the model to a consistent 53%. I felt as if the information given by these parameters was not a complete
picture of what the characters add within a champion select. I devised my own set of parameters that included a large
number of binary labels that each character would either have a true or false flag for. I also devised there might be
some higher level heuristics I could feed into the model (like hypercarry + enchanter + warden = strong hypercarry comp)
that could give some team composition level insights to the model. Unfortunately these efforts have not been successful
thus far as the model is still performing at a 53.25% accuracy. I believe the encodings I have created give the model
a better chance to understand the data, but the picture is not complete. I need to add more.
