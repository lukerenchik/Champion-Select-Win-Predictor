Options to improve model performance:

1.) Aquire more training data - There are logistical concerns with this method as getting the correct format for data &
getting the data quickly has posed a problem. But it may be worth putting in the effort to solve now, as the longer data
is being collected the more time it is able to payoff in the background

2.) Implement champion winrates - I am able to hardcode these in, but that seems very naieve, I would like to somehow
create a system where I am able to access a public published resource with these winrates to build into my application.
Additionally, I cannot calculate them from my dataset as that will incorperate bias into the model.

3.) Implement champion matchup winrates - This is an extension of the previous point where the model is able to reference
the average winrate between two champions when evaluating champion select, but I would need to create a large table
that houses all of this matchup information. I think this may be the most effective juice for getting more out of the model.
