Well I added champion features and the model got worse... LOL.

This problem is going to take some creative thought and will force me to better understand the usecases and nuances of
using NN's to solve problems.

Didn't run many tests with the parameters or model format so we could be losing ground there. Going to investigate
further tomorrow.
