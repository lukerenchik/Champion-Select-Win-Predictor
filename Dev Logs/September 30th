Well today was successful, in a way.

I was able to scrape Champion winrates from the patch where my data came from to feed the model. The problem was fairly
interesting, as I learned about to usecase of BeautifulSoup to extract information from raw html. Unfortunatly, this
winrate information/data actually hurt my models understanding of the champions and their relative strength. What this
demonstrates to me, is that champion winrate is a part of some greater trend that is embedded deeper within the game,
and that it cannot be used to describe a champions strength in isolation (aside from very extreme cases (55+ 45-)

Experiment ran, results unsatisfying but fair, will be back at it tomorrow, most likely taking a look at the embeddings
again.
